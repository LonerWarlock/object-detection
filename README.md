# 🖼️ Object Detection Web App

This web application allows users to upload images and automatically detects objects present in them. It highlights each detected object with a bounding box and displays a confidence score for every prediction — e.g., `Cat - 97%`.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Object Detection**: Detects multiple objects in a single image.
- 🎯 **Confidence Scores**: Shows how confident the model is for each prediction.
- 📦 **Image Upload**: Users can upload images from their local device.
- 🖼️ **Visual Results**: Bounding boxes drawn around each detected object with labels.
